# Treehouse-Practice-Four-In-A-Row

Object Oriented Practice
Base game from class:
Game where two players take turns dropping a token into a game board.
When one player gets 4 tokens in a row (horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally), that player wins!

My current additions:

1. Add a math problem at the beginning of each player's turn. A correct answer
   allows the player's turn to continue and an incorrect answer skips a turn and
   switches to the other player.

2. Add a player menu.
   a) Players can enter their name.
   b) Players can select addition, subtraction, multiplication, or
   division math problems (player choices can be different).
   c) Players can choose their token color (must be different colors).

3. Player choices display before game begins.

4. Added arrows that display during an active turn. Players can use arrow
   keys or buttons to move and drop token.

Future additions:

1. Allow players to edit their choices from the display page before the game
   begins.

2. Add a button to reset the game board when the game is over. Add a score
   keeper to track number of winning games.
