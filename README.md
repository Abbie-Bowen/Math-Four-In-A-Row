# Treehouse-Practice-Four-In-A-Row
Object Oriented Practice

Game where two players take turns dropping a token into a game board.
When one player gets 4 tokens in a row (horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally), that player wins! 

Plans for future additions:
1. Add a math problem at the beginning of each player's turn. If they answer
  the math problem correctly, they get to take their turn dropping their token.
  If they answer incorrectly, they would see a button that says, "Want another
  try?" that they can click to try another math problem. If they answer
  incorrectly twice in a row, the turn would switch to the other player.

2. Add a button to reset the game board when the game is over. Add a score
  keeper to track number of winning games.
