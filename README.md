# Treehouse-Practice-Four-In-A-Row
Object Oriented Practice

Game where two players take turns dropping a token into a game board.
When one player gets 4 tokens in a row (horizontally, vertically, or
diagonally), that player wins!

Plans for future additions:
1. Add a math problem at the beginning of each player's turn.
  & Allow players to select addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
    division using a button at the Start Game button overlay.

2. At the same overlay when the player selects the math type, allow user to
  type a username.

3. Add a button to reset the game board when the game is over. Add a score
  keeper to track number of winning games.
